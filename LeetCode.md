## Tips for Optimizing Python Solutions:
1. Use appropriate data structures (e.g., sets for O(1) lookup)
2. Leverage Python's built-in functions and libraries
3. Use list comprehensions for concise code
4. Understand and utilize Python's memory model

## Strategy for Using LeetCode's Study Plans:
1. Follow the "LeetCode 75" study plan for a structured approach
2. Use topic-wise problem sets to supplement your learning
3. Attempt problems from the "Top Interview Questions" list

## Approach to Problem Solving:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the constraints
2. Think about the problem for 5-10 minutes before coding
3. If stuck, try to solve for 30 minutes before looking at hints
4. Implement your solution and test with provided examples
5. Optimize your solution if it exceeds time/space limits
6. After solving or after 45 minutes, look at other solutions

## Maximizing Learning from LeetCode Discussions:
1. After solving, read the top 2-3 voted solutions
2. Understand the approach of solutions with better time/space complexity
3. Implement the best solution yourself without looking at the code
4. Contribute to discussions by explaining your approach
5. Look for solution approaches in your preferred language (Python)

Remember to track your progress using LeetCode's submission history and problem-solving statistics. Consistency is key in this learning journey. Good luck with your preparation!
